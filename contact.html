    <p>For work inquiries, questions, or general contact, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:info@rabbitgirl.me">info@rabbitgirl.me</a>. I'm most active on <a href="http://twitter.com/__rabbitgirl">twitter</a>, and my <a href="http://music.rabbitgirl.me">bandcamp</a>, <a href="http://soundcloud.com/rabbit_girl">soundcloud</a>, and <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/ritterg"> linkedin</a> profiles are also linked above.</p>

    <p>I'm probably not interested in people I don't know asking me to do free work for them, but I'm never going to say no to hearing someone out. Just don't expect a lot. </p>

    <p>If you have an <i>actual</i> job offer, feel free to send me an email! I'm currently still in school, but I will be available for work after my graduation in April 2017. My resume is <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18330644/Permanent/zzz%20-%20resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>
