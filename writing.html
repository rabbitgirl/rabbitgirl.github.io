<p>After working on story treatments, and plots, and scripts for games, comics, tv shows?, and other things that have, as of yet, not actually been made, I tried writing on a whim in January 2016 and found that a) I really liked it, and b) I was pretty okay at it. Here's a collection of everything half-decent that I've written or am working on (and can share).</p>

<h1>longform works</h1>

<p></p>

<ul>

    <li><b><a href=/writing/roots.html><i>Roots</i></a></b> (March 2013 - present):  By <em>far</em> my longest running and most ambitious project. At any given moment, <em>this</em> is probably what I'm thinking about. Roots is a story that starts with a small town, a mysterious disappearance, and the group of friends that set out to solve it - normal Spielberg stuff - and grows increasingly weird and horrifying over the following days, weeks, months, and years. It spent almost three years on my hard drive as a constantly expanding mish-mash of character outlines, scripts, and <em>extensive</em> plot notes, but as of April 2016, I'm working on making it an actual piece of literature you can read. <a href=/writing/roots.html>There's more information about about it here</a>.</li>

    <ul><li><b><i><a href="/writing/newgods.html">New Gods</a></i></b> (January 2016 - present): My first actual book. Began as a way to stay occupied during a meeting at work, and over the next 50-odd days, grew to a 75k word novel set within the Roots universe. At the moment, it remains unreleased, and available only to close friends, because it takes place <em>well</em> into the Roots story and necessarily spoils large parts of the plot.</li></ul>

    <li><b><em><a href="/writing/safety.html">Safety</a></em></b> (November 2016 - present): A short novel I wrote for <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo 2016</a> about a girl, a small coastal town, sneaking out at night, anxiety, a body in the marsh, a Thing in the water, distrust of authority, and coats. I released the <em>very</em> rough first draft as I wrote it, and you can still <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/8470309/chapters/19406956">read it here</a>. Currently: letting it sit for a month or two until it's time to rewrite the entire thing for my second draft</li>
    
    <li><b><i><a href="/writing/xatkhe.html">Xatkhe</a></i></b> (February 2016 - present): A collection of experimental poetry, short stories, and typographical art, all  centered around a young woman's exploration of a digital post-apocalypse. Perpetually in progress.</li>

    <li><b><i><a href="/writing/secondhandsmoke.html">Secondhand Smoke</a></i></b> (April 2016 - present): A collection of short slice-of-life-ish stories, revolving around the survivors of the unexplained, mass disappearance of almost every inhabitant of a cyberpunk dystopia.</li>

</ul>

<h1>short stories</h1>

<p>Assorted scraps of prose that stand alone-ish. Some of these are connected with my longer works, but aren't created to be read at any particular point in their 'parent' stories.</p>

<ul>

    <li><b><a href="/writing/_deserts.html">"Deserts In New Hampshire"</a></b> (February 2016): <i>Visit the fantastical deserts of New Hampshire today!</i> Inspired by a dream.</li>        

    <li><b><a href="/writing/_nohurry.html">"No Hurry"</a></b> (February 2016): An angel and a woman discuss the death of a galaxy.</li>

    <li><b><a href="/writing/_llliji.html">"llliji"</a></b> (February 2016): A young woman and her employer break into a holy place, surrounded by detritus and noise. The original story that prompted Xatkhe.</li>

    <li><b><a href="/writing/_reflection.html">"Call For Reflection"</a></b> (January 2016): An alien sermon. A celebration of the end of a war, and a charge to prevent it from ever happening again. </li>

</ul>
