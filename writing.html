<p>I've been writing prose since January 2016. Here's some of what I've made.</p><br>

<h1>longform works</h1>

<p></p>

<ul>

    <li><b><a href=/writing/roots.html><i>Roots</i></a></b> (March 2013 - present): My small town horror soap opera. Been in planning since my freshman year of college; currently trying to start making the thing. More information forthcoming.</li>

    <ul><li><b><i><a href="/writing/newgods.html">New Gods</a></i></b> (January 2016 - March 2016): My first actual book. Largely written by accident. Unreleased (except to friends &amp; family) because of how heavily it spoils <em>Roots</em>.</li></ul>

    <li><b><em><a href="/writing/safety.html">Safety</a></em></b> (November 2016): A short novel about a girl, a small coastal town, sneaking out at night, anxiety, a body in the marsh, a Thing in the water, distrust of authority, and coats. Written for <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo 2016</a>; that first draft is available <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/8470309/chapters/19406956">here</a>. A second draft is a possibility, but definitely not a priority.</li>
    
    <li><b><i><a href="/writing/xatkhe.html">Xatkhe</a></i></b> (February 2016 - present): A collection of experimental poetry, short stories, and typographical art, all  centered around a young woman's exploration of a digital post-apocalypse. Perpetually in progress.</li>

    <li><b><i><a href="/writing/secondhandsmoke.html">Secondhand Smoke</a></i></b> (April 2016 - present): A collection of short slice-of-life-ish stories, revolving around the survivors of the unexplained, mass disappearance of almost every inhabitant of a cyberpunk dystopia.</li>

</ul>
