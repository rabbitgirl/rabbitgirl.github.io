        <p><em><b>Project Mayura</b> was developed in Fall 2015 for my Game Concept Development and Production course at Northeastern University, alongside Bruno Agnellini, Ryan Stewart, Tom Katzman, Zack Hickman, and Dean Thurston. The assignment was to create a game targeted towards a cultural demographic in an emerging country - initially, in conjunction with Hasbro, although that particular deal fell through, due to the class's dissatisfaction with Hasbro's provided legal agreement. The final product wasn't nearly as polished as planned, but it was a learning experience nonetheless - and I remain confident in my contributions to the project.</em><p>

        <h1>background/goals</h1>

        <p>Game Concept Development and Production was (is) a course centered around a high-level view of the entire game development process. We focused on one project throughout one semester, learning how to brainstorm, research, prototype, and if possible, polish a portfolio-ready game idea. The core of the assignment was to develop a game prototype for Hasbro, targeted to a board game-playing demographic in an "emerging" country (which was, essentially, shorthand for not Euro-American), with the eventual goal of - if Hasbro liked our product - a chance at a contract with them and some kind of compensation while they turned our prototype into an actual commercial product.
        </p>
        
        <p>The collaboration with Hasbro and, in turn, the entire board game angle fell through. Many people in the class (<em>definitely</em> including myself) had reservations about working with Hasbro from the start (and I, personally, <em>really</em> didn't want to be limited to making <em>another</em> board game prototype), but as September dragged on and horror stories from fellow students piled up, more and more people grew concerned about what would be happening to our projects at the end of hte semester. When we learned that Hasbro would be refusing to make <em>any</em> changes to their proposed legal agreement, the class as a whole decided to drop the agreement and continue on our own.
        </p>
        
        <p>For the project itself - the class was divided into four (or five?) groups of five to six people each. Each group was assigned a country to design for, and every person in the group chose the development role that they felt best equipped for. I was one of three people in the class that chose a composition/sound design role, and our team ended up with India as our target country.</p>
        
        <h1>development</h1>
        
        <p>The process began with targeted research and surveys, which, in our case (and I believe in the case of several of the other teams) fell through pretty fantastically; student groups on campus either returned calls late or failed to return calls at all, professors of various cultural studies were equally unresponsive, and surveys turned up very little useful information. As a result, a lot of our research was done on the fly, as necessary - for better or worse. </p> 
        
        <p>Personally, I spent time looking at classical and contemporary Indian visual artists and composers to try and suss out an aesthetic framework for the project. Especially with regard to music, I tried to look at contemporary electronic composers - I knew that I wouldn't have access to physical Indian instruments, and couldn't afford virtual instruments or sample packs, so I researched with an eye towards modern composers who managed to utilize distinctly Indian forms of music with electronic palettes (more on that later).</p>
        
        <p>Simultaneously, we began brainstorming game concepts. We started by building a list of 100 possible ideas (about 20 from each team member), and then systematically narrowed it down to our top 20, then top 10, 5, and then two ideas that we presented to our professor. The one we went with was ambitious, to say the least, but we assured our professor that we realized the scale of our project, and were aiming for developing a small vertical slice of the theoretical final game.</p>

        <p>Our idea was to make a 3D platformer in the vein of N64-era games like Banjo-Kazooie or Super Mario 64, with a more relaxed, less intense style of gameplay and aesthetic sense inspired by more modern games like Journey and Monument Valley. We spent a lot of time developing gameplay and level ideas and trying to integrate elements of Indian mythology and culture, so as not to lose sight of our original goal. We developed a story involving an arrogant peacock prince (hence, the name of our game) on a quest to learn humility and reclaim his family palace, across seven open-ish levels based on each of the chakras.</p>
        
        <p>It was a good idea, and everyone in the team had a lot of faith in it - though we were aware that tackling even one level was probably too ambitious - but the actual process was kind of a mess, and the final product was... unsatisfying. Before I get into that - although I, like everyone else, had a hand in most of the concept development side of things, I was <em>specifically</em> assigned to working with a team member on an early draft of the level that finally made it into the game, creating some concept art, and the music/sound design. To break that down:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The level design was not a <em>particularly</em> interesting process, and I don't have most of the original notes I made, but I can sum it up: the original concept I had for the first level of our game was of a large, open field, with little to no threats or opportunities for lose states. I figured that the openness of the level would be enticing to new players, and would neatly tie in to the powerup that the player retrieved in the level - a dash ability. We started by thinking up ideas for puzzles and challenges and hiding places for our various collectables, and then considering how to best arrange them to lead the player through the level. Key was the presence of a towering ruin on a hill, on the other side of a chasm that split the level - visible from the moment the player entered the area, but unreachable until the player acquired the dash ability and could make a running jump across the gap. The pathway <em>to</em> that power was located at the bottom of the chasm, which was <em>just</em> wide enough for the player to think they could jump across; the idea being that players would attempt the jump, fall to the bottom of the chasm, and follow the path to the dash ability. The design frequently mutated and changed,  and most of my original ideas were discarded, but those two ideas and the general concept remained.</li>
            <li>The concept art actually came <em>late</em> in the process. I had created some very, <em>very</em> rough drafts when we were first brainstorming, but eventually stepped down in order to let our designated artist take over the concepting. We realized, however, when assembling our end-of-semester presentations that a) our artist hadn't actually made any concept art, and b) did not know <em>how</em> to paint or draw to a level that he was satisifed with; since my work was <em>long</em> since finished, I painted two small pieces of concept art in November, and then spent our last meeting and the night before our final presentation painting some quick last-minute images to throw into the next day's powerpoint.</li>
            <li>The sound design and music was the primary focus of my work for this project. The sound effect creation isn't really worth covering - I went home for a weekend and spent 15 minutes recording some nature sounds in my backyard - but the music was significantly more fun. To go along with the general aesthetic goal of our project, I researched contemporary and classical Indian music, looking for techniques and sounds to adapt for the game's soundscape. There was some deliberation in the team about how closely we wanted to follow classical Indian musical forms - a lot of traditional Indian music uses scales that are unfamiliar to more Western-attuned ears, and although I would've liked to have explore that tonal structure, our team eventually decided to focus on something the class as a whole would enjoy more. In addition, Indian music often emphasizes improvisation, and I ended having to abandon the playing styles of a lot of Indian folk musicians to maintain a more <em>sedate</em> sound. What I could do is put an emphasis on droning, repetetive harmonic structures, improvisation-<em>like</em> sounds - de-emphasizing a singular lead melody in favor of multiple interlocking and sometimes clashing elements - and make use of the limited samples of classical Indian instruments available to me. The final result was three tracks, two of which (I believe) made it into the game, utilizing a mix of sampled acoustic and original electronic elements, which was well recieved and which I'm still <em>very</em> proud of.</li>
        </ul>

        <br><h1>results/reflection</h1>

        <p>The development process had <em>issues.</em> Out of respect for my teammates, I won't go into the fine details of what really went down, but in the end, our finished product was just not very <em>good</em>. I still think that my music was the best part of the final game (though obviously, I'm a <em>little</em> biased), but I do think that we could've made something really good if we hadn't run into the problems we did. To summarize:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Organizationally, we were a disaster. When we were all decided on our functional roles within the team, we also decided on slightly more abstract, organizational roles - directors, managers, etc. - which we failed to maintain past the first week or so of the project, opting for a more democratic "everyone-is-their-own-boss" style organiation, inspired by the Game Design program's continual praise of Valve's 'cabal' design methodology. Let me be clear, in no uncertain terms: <em>THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.</em> I have never been part of a group where we used this kind of setup to any kind of success, and I'm beginning to believe that there is some kind of magic at the Valve headquarters that makes this structure work for them, and <em>only</em> for them. Instead of encouraging motivated creatives to branch out and make cool, interesting things for the game, we ended up with six people with no direction, and most importantly, no one at the helm to say "this is good" or "this sucks, try again."</li>
            <li>That lack of, I don't know, gatekeeping (?) was especially detrimental for me. Although I liked the music I made, I have no doubt I could've done much, <em>much</em> better. I wrote each of musical pieces in the final soundtrack <em>fairly</em> quickly, and was counting on my group members to provide feedback so I could iterate and develop my concepts further. But what I got was a unanimous response of "okay, nice," and so a <em>lot</em> of my time after that initial sound creation was spent idly tweaking bits of the music and hoping that more work opened up. (The narcissistic part of wants to think that my work was Just That Good, but let's be real, here.)</li>
            <li>The largest problem is, again, rooted in that lack of accountability to a director or a producer of some kind - people just didn't show up to meetings. Or, on occasion, do their work - we VERY rarely had all six people show up to any given meeting, and when people skipped or were unable to attend, they usually failed to send a message or a text saying that they wouldn't be attending. We actually began with three team meetings a week, at the start of the semester, but cut that down to two a week by the end of October, after I showed up to the Wendesday meeting three (or maybe four?) weeks in a row and found that no one else did. (To toot my own horn: I made it to almost every single meeting bar, I think, one - an attendance record no one else matched.)</li>
            <li>Overly ambitious expectations were also a problem. Again, not necessarily with the scale of our project - we all knew that we were biting off more than we could chew, but we never had a point where every member of the team got together and said "this is my past work, and this is what I can do," and as a result, we frequently planned for things that were outside of the capabilites of our tema members.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I could go on. The lack of an organiational tool like Trello meant no one knew what anyone else was working on; issues getting Unity to work with Git resulted in <em>huge</em> amounts of headaches; a lack of internal playtesting meant people lost a sense of investment in their work and obvious bugs just stuck around for far too long - the point is, for all the really fantastic plans we had, the execution was fumble after fumble after fumble.</p>
        
        <p>So, what was my takeaway? What do we need next time?</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Projects of <em>any</em> non-trivial scale require someone at the helm. We don't need a Kojima-esque auteur micromanaging everything, but anarchy is absolutely not acceptable.</li>
            <li>More prototyping. We need mechanics in place <em>well</em> before we enter the polish phase.</li>
            <li>Clear, consistent communication, with regards to who is doing what and what they <em>can</em> do.</li>
            <li><em>Accountability.</em> At the end of the day, as long as I'm in school there's very little we can do about this - we can't really fire people and look for more punctual or motivated workers - but moving forward...</li>
            <li>Get people more involved with brainstorming, content creation, and idea generation, regardless of what part of the project we're doing. We need people to stick in their roles when it comes to actually making the stuff, but it would've been nice if the whole group had been more involved in higher-level design decisions.</li>
            <li>Making sure meetings are for meetings, and don't just become work cycles for people to do the work they <em>should've</em> been doing on their own time.</li>
            <li>USE TRELLO.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That's all. Work harder next time. Take less bullshit. Find people who will actually do their work.</p>
