<p><em><b>Throw Your Snow</b> was developed in Spring of 2015 for my Game Programming course at Northeastern University, alongside Jordan Dewitt, Korbin Shuffleton, Theo Tspakos, and Thiago Mendes. The  assignment was developed in conjunction with <a href="http://ohheckyeah.com/">OhHeckYeah</a>, who were interested in collaborating with the class to develop a series of intuitive, highly accessible motion-based games, to be played around the Northeastern Campus during Commencement week. Our game was built in Unity, to be controlled with the <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">LeapMotion Plus</a>. The game was well-recieved, and our group was awarded Most Innovative Game at that semester's Game Demo Day. Footage of the game can be seen throughout the <a href="https://vimeo.com/127516372">OhHeckYeah video</a> (briefly, and most clearly at 0:29); public distributions are not currently available, but I'd be more than happy to walk through the code with anyone interested in person and on request. Project documentation and reports are also available on request, but out of deference to my colleagues, I've elected not to make them publicly available. Send any and all requests to <a href="mailto:info@rabbitgirl.me">info@rabbitgirl.me</a>.</em></p>
