        <p>I chose to tackle this project for two reasons. The first was a renewed interest in Roots and the characters depicted in the game; I had first started developing them in the spring of 2013, but had only seriously comitted to working on the story in mid-fall 2014. The second reason was a recent fascination with text adventures and adventure games in general, spurred on by a prior assignment in my Programming in C++ course. The synthesis of the two seemed like a good opportunity to try and make something concrete out of my story and try my hand at more involved engine development.</p>

        <p>Going into the project, I had three real goals:</p>

        <ul>
            
            <li>Learn to use SDL. The graphical component of our project was left up to us, and I didn't have the patience to learn OpenGL for some simple 2D graphics.</li>
            
            <li>Create a scripting system and a parser for it. One of the more annoying parts of the text adventure assignment that spawned this game was having to create even a relatively short assignment in my IDE; I was really attached to creating a modular text parser that would allow me (or anyone else) to script the game using text files and a set of simple commands.</li>
            
            <li>Actually write a game. Story, dialogue, direct character movements, the whole nine yards.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Design-wise, the game was pretty simple from the get-go. I modeled it after the Famicom Detective Club games, as well as the Ace Attorney franchise and similar adventure games. Players would have to travel from room to room, talking to other characters and gathering items from the environment. I intended the game to be about ten to fifteen minutes long.</p>

        <br><h1>results/reflection</h1>

        <p>Long story short, I'm really proud of the results of this project. The end result isn't as good as I was hoping it would be, but I definitely learned to readjust my expectations over time, and learned a lot in general about game development. I'll go into more detail, but first - about those goals:</p>

        <ul>
            
            <li>Learning to use SDL was... interesting. I really like SDL, and have used it in several projects since, but for some reason I had a lot of issues with it in this project. I suspect a lot of them were due to issues with my compiler being out of date, since most of my issues haven't resurfaced in more recent projects. I also had a lot of problems with a <em>severe</em> lack of documentation for SDL2, but I managed to figure thigns out and have a better hold on the language as a result.</li>
            
            <li>The scripting system was probably my favorite thing to work on, and my favorite part of the final project. It isn't super well documented, but it's functional and not super buggy. It was a huge part of the project, but it's flexible enough that I could conceivably use it to tell any story I wanted, which was ultimately what I wanted.</li>
            
            <li>I learned that I am not a game writer! At least, not when I put off the writing until the last minute and don't really have the time or passion to care about what I'm writing. I would actually love to write for games someday, but most of the writing process on this was spent thinking about how much I'd rather be writing a serious story. It was a good experience nonetheless, but the story doesn't really make a lot of sense and a lot of the jokes fall really flat, and now you know why!</li>
            
        </ul>

        <p>Some final notes: the most important takeaway from this was that <em>games take a long time to make.</em> I had an idea of how long games take to code, and I was mostly on the mark about that! I finished up my code just on time, but I didn't expect how long writing and scripting everything would take me. There isn't really that much dialogue here, but it still took a long time to put together all the same. I was putting together the last bits of dialogue up to about thirty seconds before the project was due, and I won't make that mistake again (probably).</p>
        
        <p>There was also a lot that didn't make it into the game - the animations are all pretty restricted to eye and mouth movements, but I would've liked a chance to have included some more expressive animations, since the result looks pretty cheap. I also, as with <a href="/portfolio/recycle.html">Recycle</a> (which was developed concurrently), wrote some music for the game that never made it in.</p>
        
        <p>Overall though, I'm pleased with the result. I accomplished what I set out to do, and I ended up with a really solid framework to build off of in future games. I've considered revisiting this engine to tell an actual story in the Roots continuity, but I don't really have anything planned as of yet. As usual, I wish I had the time to do more, but I count this as a success.</p>
