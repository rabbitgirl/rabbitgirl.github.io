        <p><em><b>The Gone Home RPG</b> was developed in Fall of 2014 for my Rapid Idea Prototyping for Games course at Northeastern University. The goal of the assignment was to take a somewhat recent digital game (all of them mechanically light "art games") and find a way to turn it into an analog game. I chose <a href="http://www.gonehomegame.com/">Gone Home</a>, developed by Fullbright and released in 2013. Although my end result wasn't hugely successful, I count it as an important learning experience. My report is as follows; my original notes are available <a href ="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18330644/Permanent/10-20-14%20Notes%20for%20CS3700.rtf">here</a> (.rtf).</em></p>
            
        <br><h1>introduction</h1>
        
        <p>In adapting Gone Home for a non-digital environment, I decided pretty quickly that I wanted to retain the focus on narrative and exploration that Gone Home had, while trying not to tie myself down to a predetermined story. I wanted to keep the game modular and open multiple playthroughs up to vastly different results, and so I started with a mechanically light, roleplaying/improvisation heavy game. I held on to the original premise of the game - the protagonist returns to a house they're unfamiliar with after a long absence, and has to discover where people have gone and what's happened in their absence. I wanted to try to make the game multiplayer, so I decided early on that one player should act as the protagonist, and the other act as a "game master" of sorts - creating the mystery for the player and narrating their journey throughout the house - and moved forward from there.</p>

        <p><em>The floor plan for the house proper.</em></p>

        <br><h1>original concpet</h1>

        <p>I created a makeshift map by gluing index cards to some cardboard lying around and made a small set (about 20) of cards from cutting index cards into thirds. I wrote down one miscellaneous household object or weird set pieces on each card for players to work off of. My original rules were as follows:</p>

        <ul>
        
            <li>At start of game, players decide between themselves who will be the protagonist and who will be the "game master"</li>
            
            <li>The game master draws five cards from the deck and uses them to create an answer to the mystery "where did everyone go?" They do not tell the player what any of the cards are, and they arrange them in the house as needed. </li>
        
            <li>At this point, the player begins the game in the foyer. The "game master" narrates the setting of each room to the player as they enter them and creates responses to any action the player wants to undertake. Once a player has found a piece of evidence, the card is flipped face-up.</li>
        
            <li>When a player believes they can solve the mystery, they are allowed to give their theory. If they are right, everyone wins! If they're wrong, there's no penalty - they can try again, or keep looking for clues.</li>
                
        </ul>

        <p>My first playtesting session immediately brought up some glaring flaws.</p>
 
        <ul>
        
            <li>The DMs didn't really have time to prepare a cohesive mystery beforehand, and as a result, a lot of the details of the mystery that were supposed to be pre-determined ended up being ad libbed anyways.</li>
        
            <li>Having all of the cards on the map right from the get go - even if they were face down - meant that the protagonist knew exactly what rooms to check in order to get evidence. This wasn't a huge issue, and the game moved a lot faster than expected as a result, but it really robbed the game of the explorative aspect I was going for.</li>
        
            <li>Randomly pulling five objects from the deck was far too random in what the player got - sometimes players got a good mix of objects, sometimes they only got completely banal household objects, and sometimes they only got really weird stuff. Not only did I need better variation in my objects, I needed a better draw method.</li>
                
        </ul>

        <p><em>The protagonist can see the left side of the image, but the right side is blocked from their view.</em></p>

        <br><h1>iteration 1</h1>

        <p>With the feedback from the first playtesting, I took the time to create about twice as many cards as before, sort them into separate piles, and make a quick, smaller-scale paper map. I also took another piece of cardboard I had in my room that folded perfectly enough to work as a makeshift GM screen. The rule changes were:</p>

        <ul>
        
            <li>Objects are sorted into three piles of cards; the GM draws five from the first, three from the second, and one from the third. The first pile is composed of completely normal household objects - couches, pots, lamps, nails, soda cans, etc. The second pile is also composed of normal objects, but is geared towards objects that lend themselves to providing more information and clues - sketchbooks, computers, books, records, etc. The last pile is made up of weird and supernatural stuff - Ouija boards, pentagrams, glowing rocks, etc.</li>
        
            <li>The GM is allowed to use as many or as few of the cards as they want.</li>
        
            <li>When the GM is setting up their mystery, they keep a smaller version of the map behind a GM screen. They place their cards on this map, and when a player discovers the evidence, they move the cards onto the larger map that the player has access to. This way, the GM can keep track of where things are, while preventing the player from immediately going to the rooms with evidence in them.</li>
        
            <li>DMs get as much time as they need and is reasonable to formulate their stories beforehand.</li>
               
        </ul>

        <p><em>Top: The separate piles of card. This picture is recent, hence the included blank cards. Bottom: some of the weird cards from the third stack.</em></p>

        <p>With new rules and more cards in mind, I jumped into my second playtesting session. Unfortunately, it wasn't nearly as productive as I had hoped; my GM didn't really understand the rules going into it, which no one realized until halfway through the game, at which point the mystery had become totally nonsensical and ridiculous. While that was certainly entertaining, it wasn't very productive, and I came away with two observations:</p>

        <img src="http://static.tumblr.com/xi4q7k3/G70nn2ujq/5.jpg">

        <p><em>The game board before any evidence has been discovered.</em></p>

        <ul>
        
            <li>I need to do a better job explaining the rules. I hadn't brought a formalized list of rules to the first two tests, preferring to go off the top of my head, but that obviously hadn't worked here. I needed to get a sheet of paper with the actual rules on it and just read them off.</li>
        
            <li>Getting people with little to no experience to roleplay is extraordinarily difficult (myself included). I'm not sure that there's much I can do about this - it might just be a consequence of the game type. It would be nice if the game was more open to newcomers, but I don't think it's a necessity.</li>
                
        </ul>

        <br><h1>iteration 2</h1>

        <img src="http://static.tumblr.com/xi4q7k3/ixsnn2uk7/6.jpg">

        <p><em>The GM's point of view.</em></p>

        <p>Unfortunately, due to the poor results of the previous iteration, I didn't have a lot of changes to enact for my third version. I essentially used it as a way to make up for the previous iteration. The only changes I made were:</p>
    
        <ul>
        
            <li>If the GM is totally unsatisfied with the hand they've been dealt, they may discard everything they have and draw a new set of cards. </li>
        
            <li>The GM is allowed a degree of freedom with modifying the objects they draw. If they get a sketchbook, for example, they can say what was drawn in it, or they can say that a lamp is broken, but they can't modify it to the extent that it just spells out the mystery. This was already part of the rules, but I had never really cleared it up beforehand - I had just thought it was kind of implied.</li>
                
        </ul>

        <p>Luckily, I got a very important piece of feedback, though it was definitely a lot less positive than I was hoping for.</p>

        <ul>
        
            <li>The GM/Player roles just aren't working. The entirety of the storytelling lies on the GM, forcing them to basically carry the entire game on their shoulders, while the player has basically nothing to do but stumble through the game and HOPE that the GM made a solvable mystery. If either player isn't totally interested and invested, then neither of them are going to be able to have any fun.</li>
                
        </ul>

        <br><h1>iteration 3</h1>

        <p>For my most recent (and at the moment, final) iteration, I've decided to make some pretty major changes. As a result, this iteration is a lot shakier and less polished than my last one, but I'd rather dump what isn't working and go back to it later in the interest of making progress. Taking the feedback from the last session into account, I decided to change the rules as following:</p>

        <ul>
        
            <li>Both players take on a dual game master/protagonist role. At the start of the game, each player draws the same amount of cards and creates a mystery based around it.</li>
        
            <li>There is only one map. Players place their cards face down on the map in whatever rooms they wish once they've planned out their mystery.</li>
        
            <li>Players trade off turns - on each turn, one player is the protagonist, and the other player is the GM, but once the protagonist has made their move, they switch roles. Essentially, both players are running their own mysteries side by side and simply swapping which one they are currently focused on.</li>
        
            <li>Because both players are using the same map, no GM screens are needed.</li>
            
            <li>Optionally, add a little competition - encourage players to create interesting and clear stories by awarding points to whoever's mystery is solved first.</li>
        
            <li>In addition to the normal set of cards, each player gets one blank card that they can write anything down on.</li>
            
        </ul>

        <p>Without even testing it, I can already predict a few issues:</p>

        <ul>
        
            <li>Simultaneously exploring and trying to tell a story at the same time can be difficult. It might end up being more difficult than the original game.</li>
        
            <li>I'm going back to putting all the cards on the board from the start, even if they are face down. This does re-introduce the problem of players instantly going to rooms with evidence, but with two stories, the game will probably take about twice as long. I'd rather test this approach and see if it makes the game move at a decent speed.</li>
        
            <li>With regards to the competitive aspect - it's totally feasible for a player to create a SUPER EASY mystery and lead their competitor right into it for a quick point. It's also feasible for a player to be really obtuse and purposefully not solve a mystery just to deprive their opponent of a point. There isn't really anything to do for this except add a third player to be a judge, but that seems a little overcomplicated. I'd rather leave it up to the players to act fair, but I'm not that attached to the competitive aspect either. I'd like to see if it works, but I'll drop it quickly if it doesn't.</li>
           
        </ul>

        <p><em>The (much messier) most recent iteration. The dice were used to track player location.</em></p>

        <p>Having actually had the chance to test it in class, I'm pretty pleased with the feedback I got:</p>

        <ul>
        
            <li>The dual mysteries actually worked really well. They were a little confusing at first (I need to solidify when exactly a turn ends), but they kept the flow of the game interesting and prevented either player from getting bored in their role. In addition, the novelty of exploring the same house through two separate mysteries at the same time created an interesting contrast between how players used similar and different locations, objects, and themes (for example: in our session, my story was about some teens getting arrested for partying too hard, while my partner's was about a gruesome murder perpetrated by a spurned lover).</li>
        
            <li>The wild cards were a perfect addition and really helped to tie the game together. They were instrumental in moving stories from a scattering of objects and ideas to a solid, concise mystery.</li>
        
            <li>The living room needs to be connected to the rest of the house. As it is, there's only one way in/out and it's a bit of a hassle to get to.</li>
        
            <li>The redraws are a good idea, but limiting them to one redraw doesn't really help. Possibly let players redraw until there aren't any cards left?</li>
        
            <li>Putting all the cards on the map WAS a little hectic, and it was difficult to keep track of who's were who's (at least while they were face down). Consider just having players write down where undiscovered evidence is on a pad of paper or something.</li>
                
        </ul>

        <p><em>Some blank card choices.</em></p>

        <br><h1>reflection</h1>

        <p>When I was first figuring out how I wanted to adapt Gone Home, I started by breaking it down to the core narrative and mechanical components and seeing what I was interested in working with. Narratively, I wanted to keep the core conceit of the game - coming home to a house that was empty and unfamiliar - but wasn't interested in locking into the environment or details of the game. It didn't have to be the 90s, it didn't have to be a standard nuclear family, and none of the specific domestic struggles present in Gone Home had to be present in the adaptation. Instead, I wanted to keep the general focus on domestic life, while freeing it open to a wide range of stories and player experiences. Mechanically, I would say there are four major systems in Gone Home: moving from room to room, exploring and interacting with physics objects in the room, unlocking doors and opening up new parts of the house, and discovering audio logs that flesh out the story.</p>

        <p>The first system is easily adapted to an analog game, though I was wary to take the classic board game route and grid out the board into tiles to move between. I considered it at first, but realized that it didn't really do anything – all it did was lengthen the time taken to move through a room. The second system is a little problematic as well – since an analog game doesn't have the advantage of a physics engine, object interaction would have to come down to actually looking at physical objects (which would require having a huge set of household objects that to just lug around – not a great option), or putting the onus of describing the environment and the objects in it on the narrator player (which I ultimately went with).</p>

        <p>The third mechanic is actually one that I considered but hadn't gotten around to implementing yet – when first planning out the game, I was interested in the idea of the game master not only creating a mystery, but also building the house out of modular pieces (or having the player build the house, while the game master built a mystery for it). I eventually abandoned it in favor of a static house map in an attempt to simplify things and put less of a burden on the game master, but with that came the decision to abandon the idea of having keys hidden throughout the house and keeping parts of it locked off. The reason that Gone Home's system of gatekeeping works is because the titular house is massive (and frankly, kind of ridiculously designed); in a smaller house that's necessary for my approach, locked doors don't really make as much sense.</p>

        <p>The fourth and final mechanic is what I really took as the mechanical core of Gone Home and wanted to keep as the core of my adaptation. That choice led me to the initial decision to keep things mechanically light and pursue a roleplaying-heavy direction. I wanted to allow players to create a unique dialogue between a player and a narrator, similar to how the player in Gone Home works to decipher and create a dialogue between the silent protagonist and the history throughout the house. The inherent problem with a narrative focused game is that any degree of polish necessitates pre-defined elements, but I was willing to compromise polish on individual narratives by encouraging people to make up their own stories. I've always been a fan of the idea of pen and paper RPGs (a la Dungeons and Dragons or Paranoia), and really wanted to let that player developed narrative shine through (though my own inexperience with pen and paper RPGs might have hurt me in the end).</p>

        <p>What I wanted to avoid, however, was the oversimulation and dense mechanics that often come with pen and paper RPGs. While I tend to enjoy complex mechanics (verging on obtuse and overcomplexity), I really didn't think it was a good fit for what I was aiming for. Gone Home is a comparatively bare bones game mechanically, and rather than create a beat-to-beat recreation of every single action in Gone Home, I wanted to create a launching point for player directed experiences. Ultimately, the only part of my game that isn't player directed is the initial action of drawing the cards. Everything that comes after that is up to the player to make work; the ruleset is minimalistic enough there isn't really anything else for them to fall back on.</p>

        <p>The cards are an idea I still really enjoy. I realized from the get-go that not giving the player ANY starting points wouldn't work, and thought that the best solution was to add an element of challenge for both players that informed the construction of each play session and the win state. The cards are generally vague enough that a crafty player can bend them to whatever use they want, but still provide the limitations needed to focus a story. The mystery is really the core of the game, and making sure that it's focused and concise is vital to keeping the game running.</p>

        <p>So. Did it work?</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, I'd have to say no. With more time and more feedback, I'm confident I could make this work, but as it stands now, it's really raw. I still like the core idea – I think that keeping the narrative focus is essential to keeping the spirit of the original game alive, and making the game too mechanically heavy gets too far away from what makes the game special (and at that point, there's not a lot of point of saying your game is inspired by Gone Home). The roleplaying structure really reinforces that focus, but I think that (especially for my playtesters in particular) the minimalist mechanics don't give the players enough of a framework to build off of. If I continued to develop this (which I don't think I will), I'd really like to experiment with finding a nice balance between the player-driven, loosely defined structure I have now, and a more complex and rigid ruleset. Ultimately, if my players won't engage, there isn't that much I can do, but I'd like to at least try.</p>

        <p>Something else I'd have liked to investigate that I really had no idea how to implement in the first place (and wasn't really a priority) was the atmosphere of isolation present in Gone Home. The experience of exploring of big, quiet house that you didn't know your way around and was (probably) empty was a fantastic component of the original game. Unfortunately, I don't really know how to implement that in an analog version with multiple players. The addition of a second player automatically combats the feeling of isolation, and systemizing the loneliness (with a scare meter or something?) feels kind of cheap. That might just be a limitation of the medium.</p>

        <p>Finally, I'm not sure that I struck the right balance between inspired by Gone Home and adapting it literally. I definitely could've leaned more in either direction, but I feel like even without simulating the game directly, my version plays it a little too straight. </p>
