        <p><u><b>Roots</b></u> is a story about a group of friends investigating and dealing with <em>weird stuff</em> in the small town of Linford.  I started writing it in 2013 as a way to process and distract me from what was going on in my life. In 2016, it's still mostly that, but it's grown to a little under 100,000 words of notes written over three years, and 150,000 words of prose written in 2016 alone. I can't say when it's going to be out there in the wild, but it'll be soon - and until then, keep those ears open, watch the woods, and listen to the Current...</p><br>

        <img src=http://static.tumblr.com/xi4q7k3/DfUnjongr/jess.png><br>Jess Lowe.  17. Athletic, ambitious, and at the head of her class, Jess's world was finally coming together when Zack's disappearance blew it to pieces. Despite the rumors flying around Town, Jess refuses to believe that Zack is gone, and along with Tom, begins her own investigation into where Zack is, what he was doing, and what happened to him.<br><br><br><br>

        <br>Thomas Sanders. 17. Best friend to both Jess and Zack from a very young age. Tom doesn't have nearly as much ambition or talent as Jess, and is honestly kind of a loser - but he's deeply loyal to the Lowes, and will gladly do whatever he can to help Jess find closure.

        <br><br>Lucas May. 16. Zack's best friend and confidant, Luke is somewhat of a mystery. Luke as a bit of an outside, and neither Jess or Tom <em>really</em> know them that well While their motives appear honest, and their dedication to Zack is real, it seems that Luke has some secrets of their own...
        <br><br><br><br><img src=http://static.tumblr.com/xi4q7k3/alQnjoni2/zack.png><br>Zack Lowe. 16. Presumed dead by most. Zack's always been weird, but in a sort-of normal, creative teenager way. The last year, however, has seen him grow increasingly erratic and withdrawn, and his disappearance isn't as surprising as one might think. But as Tom and Jess will soon find, there's more to Zack's disappearance than what's on the surface...
