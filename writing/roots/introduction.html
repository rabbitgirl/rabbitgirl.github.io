<br>in the northern hemisphere of a
<br>temperate, life bearing planet
<br>
<br>lies a smallish town 
<br>called Linford
<br>
<br>((pop. 7,124)
<br>(est. 1025))
<br>
<br>comprised
<br>(mostly)
<br>of
<br>
<br>farms, residential
<br>neighborhoods, a
<br>small downtown,
<br>a waterfront,
<br>a small train
<br>station
<br>
<br>and so on and 
<br>so forth.
<br>
<br>summers are short.
<br>winters are long.
<br>(and cold.)
<br>
<br>the City is close.
<br>(but not too close.)
<br>
<br>life in Linford is quiet.
<br>(but not too quiet.)
<br>
<br>the woods are safe.
<br>(but not too safe.)
<br>
<br>this particular day
<br>(June 28th, 1262)
<br>is a cause for
<br>celebration.
<br>
<br>(for many people.)
<br>
<br>summer is around the corner,
<br>and for the denizens of
<br>the Linford Regional
<br>High School,
<br>
<br>(and for another,)
<br>
<br>freedom
<br>
<br>is almost at hand.
<br>
<br>the end-of-day bell 
<br>
<br>(a tone, actually;
<br>sweet digital
<br>herald of
<br>escape)
<br>
<br>is minutes away.
<br>
<br>the end of the school year.
<br>the end of the semester.
<br>(and for a few of them:
<br>the end of everything
<br>that defines their
<br>day-to-day lives.)
<br>
<br>
<br>they can hardly wait.
