<p class="p2"><b></b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Old Linford - the 'old town' - was really less of a <i>town</i> than it was a burned out, grown over, rotting, decrepit <i>husk</i> of what might've passed for a town a long, <i>long</i> time ago - and even then, it would've been stretching the definition of the word.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>But even if it wasn't really a <i>town</i> - just a collection of <i>maybe</i> twenty crumbling shapes of houses - it sure as <i>shit</i> was <i>old</i>.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The 'old town' was hidden away behind a corroded, rusted gate (more of an iron pipe over the road, to be honest) stretching across a backroad of a backroad, past a dozen abandoned fields gone to fallow and a dozen more still in use, past the neighborhoods and shops and schools of Linford proper, tucked into the background far, far away from the modern, respectable, well-kept core of the town. Old Linford had burnt to the ground some two hundred years ago for some reason or another (depending on who you asked: a forest fire gone awry, a livestock-lantern conflict, an attack from bandits, an intentional act of arson, "because little boys didn't brush their teeth before going to bed," or as local superstition told, <i>the Witch's revenge</i>, a story which was still retold and celebrated in the annual summer festival), prompting the inhabitants' exodus to Linford's current location on the other side of the Payeta Lake. Through-travelers would've had to dig deep to find any mention of the ruins outside of local folklore, and farther still to find any mention of their location; to the residents of the town, however, the exact set of directions needed to get to the gate and the wooded remains that lay beyond was common knowledge. It was just one of those things that everyone <i>knew</i> - it was the town's haunted house and wholly unsupervised burnout hangout all in one, and everyone had either visited at some point, or was eagerly looking forward to visiting when they got up the nerve.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Legally</i>, of course, the town was completely, absolutely, one hundred percent off limits - condemned for as long as anyone could remember - and trespassing was punishable by jail time, or at least a stern talking to. But in practice, that meant about as much as the "gate" that swung open with a stiff breeze.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>No, the town was a popular destination for teenagers looking for a secluded place to smoke, drink, or fuck, and most of Linford's populace over the age of fifteen had been there at one point or another (either in their current youth or in their long-past glory days). Tom and Jess were notable exceptions: Jess, because she was a Good Girl who didn't drink or fuck (though a very, <i>very</i> occasional smoke wasn't out of the question, if one of the girls had a lighter after practice and was willing to share a cig), and Tom because he was kind of a weenie, and tended not to Go Places very often unless Jess dragged him with.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Like, for example, now.</p>
    <br>
<p class="p1"><b>[ </b><span class="s3">Δ </span><b>]</b></p>
    <br>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>"This is fucking stupid," Tom muttered.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Tom had been apprehensive at <i>best</i> when Jess declared their next destination was the <i>haunted ghost town in the middle of the forest</i>, but adding a fine layer of freshly birthed mud into the equation was really pushing it. The onslaught of yesterday's storm had put an early end to their excursion, and they had parted (Jess's heart a little lighter, Tom's weighed down with a creeping sense of foreboding) with a promise to regroup tomorrow, but now - for the second day in a row - Tom was awake <i>well</i> before any self respecting person should be during the summer, and was having just a fan-fucking-<i>tastic </i>time navigating the results of previous day's deluge.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><del>On top of it all, Tom was pretty sure this whole thing was a <i>major </i>waste of time, but he wisely kept that thought to himself.</del></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>"Chin up, Tom," Jess said with a <i>way</i> too much cheer for him to even deal with at the moment. Even the deepest depths of the <del>affection</del> <i>close friendshipness</i> he felt for Jess didn't keep her voice from grating against every single fiber of his oversized ears. "Look, whatever we find in there, it'll be an adventure, right? Come on - when was the last time we took the time to just relax and <i>walk</i> in the woods for a bit?"</p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Summers prior, in fact, had been <i>filled</i> with walks in the woods. Despite Tom's predilection for staying indoors and minimizing physical activity, he still had a not-insignificant love of nature, (of quiet drifting hikes through the countryside) (of momentary respite under a tree as a summer storm floated past) (of afternoons where the sunset's reflection was only disturbed by ripples (rocks skipping over the lake)), a passion he shared with the Lowe siblings. Since they had first met, Tom and Jess (and a little later, Zack) had spent plenty of carefree days stomping around in the woods behind their respective houses, and as they grew older, the range of their explorations expanded to include the hills and forests surrounding Linford (and (once cars entered the equation) beyond). They were good times (and - for a moment - Tom suddenly felt the real, tangible absence (hole) that Zack had left behind - every memory of a quiet, easy day suddenly tainted by the echoing <i>never again <span style="font-size:10px">(never again <span style="font-size:8px">(never again)</span>)</span> </i>, the knowledge that any future such memories would necessarily be absent one Lowe forever (and then it <i>really</i> hit him, oh god (how is Jess even holding it <i>together?</i>)) - and then the moment was gone), but this wasn't really that.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>"Our walks in the woods," Tom grumbled as he stomped after Jess into the trees, ((needlessly?) locking his car doors behind him, (the <i>chck-beep!</i> momentarily breaking the silence of the forest)), "did not <i>typically</i> involve spooky ghost towns."</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span style="font-size: 10px">"Well, maybe they should've,"</span> came the distant reply of the rapidly fading speck that was Jess Lowe.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>"Yeah, well, maybe - Fuck, Jess, you mind slowing down a bit?" Tom trudged through the mud morosely, finding a <i>slightly</i> shallower path through the mud (pressed into place by the treads of some truck that had apparently decided to park a little closer to the town itself), until the speck grew back into something recognizable as his friend. "Jeez, Jess," Tom panted. "We can't all be track stars."</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Jess just clucked and shook her head disapprovingly. "Oh, Tom. We really need to get you running or <i>something</i>." <span class="s4">(<i>fuck </i>running (though, maybe running with Jess wouldn't be such a bad</span> "Come on, I think the mud's thinning out ahead."</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>It was, and before long, the muddy slog had become a quiet trek through the woods, more reminiscent of those past walks than when they had started - which was nice, as was the smell of the pines and the pungent post-rainstorm odor that hung over the needles, both above and below. The slight breeze was nice. The birdsong was nice. Being with Jess was <span class="s4">nice</span> pretty good. Everything was nice,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

And if Jess noticed, she didn't say anything, because she suddenly seemed a little preoccupied with zipping up her orange windbreaker and rubbing her arms to get warm in the seventy-two degree morning air.</p>
<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The thing about Old Linford being a Hot Teen Destination was that, despite what people <i>said</i>, most of the smoke/drink/fucking actually happened in the small patch of flat grass just inside of the gate. The small patch of grass where a couple of cars could fit comfortably (where, in happens, Tom and Jess had parked), you could spread out a picnic blanket and maybe a cooler or two, and have a generally good time - and at the end of the day, you could tell people that you had "gone to the old town" without <i>technically </i>lying, and most importantly, without actually stepping foot anywhere near the ruins ruins. This is because the 'town' proper was, to put it mildly:</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><i>really</i></p>
<p class="p1"><i>fucking</i></p>
<p class="p5"><i>creepy,</i></p>
<p class="p4"><br><br><br></p>
<p class="p2">something that became more and more apparent with each step that Tom took into the forest.</p>
