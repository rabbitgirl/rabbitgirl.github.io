<p><b><i>New Gods</i></b> is a novel following <span class=white>XXXXXX XXXXXX</span> and <span class=white>XXXX</span> as they wander the world in search of a new home, new lives, and <span class=white>X XXXX</span>. </p>

<p>And that's all I can say about it. </p>

<p>I started writing <i>New Gods</i> in January 2016 in the middle of a very long, very slow work meeting as, well, kind of a joke. A way to pass some time that was a little bit less obvious than drawing or working on music at work. I had never written prose before, and I doubted I was suddenly going to start then - it was just a handful of notes, a bundle of connective tissue stringing together two stages of <i>Roots</i> that I hadn't <i>quite</i> figured out yet. Then it turned into a short story of a couple thousand words. Then a plan for maybe eight short chapters that I could release at some point in the future. </p>
    <p>50-odd days later, I put the last period on a first draft that was 75k words long and realized that I had accidentally written a small novel.</p>

<p>Which was scary, but kind of cool. And made me start thinking about what <i>else</i> I could write.</p>

<p>As it stands, <i>New Gods</i> is not publicly available. Beyond a small group of friends and my mom, no one has read it, and no one <i>can</i> - not yet. The problem with not thinking I was going to <i>finish</i> this is that I didn't really think about anyone reading it, and I made the mistake of not starting at the beginning. <i>New Gods</i> takes place a <i>long</i> way into <i>Roots</i>, my primary story, and contains numerous world-shattering spoilers for that story - which, understandably, I want to remain unspoiled. So, for now, <i>New Gods</i> is going to sit on my hard drive (and a few other folks') until I get far enough in <i>Roots</i> that I can dust it off and send it out into the world.</p>

<p>That said, I'm still really proud of this story, so here are a few samples with character names and some details redacted:</p>
