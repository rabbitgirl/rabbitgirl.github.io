<p><b><i>Xatkhe</i></b> is a collection of experimental poetry, short stories, and typographical art, all centered around a young woman's exploration of a digital post-apocalypse.</p>

<p>The book is comprised of poetry and journal entries written the "protagonist" as she wanders the remains of a dead world - scarred by blistering, digital storms, stalked by creatures beyond our ken, hissing sickly nothings into the unhearing air  - sparse narration of her travels, flickers of the noise drowning the world, and whispers of the world that was.</p>

<p>Version 1 hopefully out soon, with potential revisions/expansions/updates whenever I feel like it.</p>
