    <p><em><a href="http://bitbucket.org/rabbitgirl/sclera">Sclera</a></em> is an in-progress 2D game engine, written in C++ and using SFML (and OpenGL) for graphics/input/sound handling. Emphasis on the "in-progress" - I'm still very much in the process of building out the architecture, and most of what I want in the final product is barely working or is completely non-functioning.</p>
    <p>My goals with <em>Sclera</em> are to build an engine that I can use for a wide variety of games moving forward - to, hopefully, make THE engine that I can use for any future 2D game projects, to minimize messing around with making someone else's engine work for me. It's also largely an educational exercise - to teach myself the ins and outs of engine design, better architectural design practices, to learn more about how every aspect of engines in general <em>work</em> - and because it's fun, when I'm not tearing my hair out.</p>
    <p>The general aesthetic I'm aiming for is "Gameboy Advance games with modern hardware," though I'm certainly leaving room for a wide variety of styles. I'm also trying to put an emphasis on keeping all of my file specifications human-readable and editable (within reason), to allow curious players to reverse engineer projects they like, and to allow frustrated developers to get right into the file they want to edit without having to wait for a GUI editor to boot up.</p>
    <p>Beyond that, the project is not particularly special - I'm not working on the cutting-edge of anything, I'm just trying to make something that does what I want it to. When it's done (or, at least, done enough), I plan on cleaning it up, writing some documentation, and releasing it to the public - for now, though, you can still <a href="http://bitbucket.org/rabbitgirl/sclera">take a look at it on bitbucket</a> if you want.</p>
    <p>Currently, I'm working towards hitting a significant milestone by April 2017 - a feature-complete enough version of the engine that can support some kind of little arena combat game. Nothing too flashy - the real difficulty (I think) is going to be expanding the engine past that to support games with greater state and scriptic complexity - but we'll see if the project maintains my interest long enough to hit it.</p>
