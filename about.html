        <br><br>

        <p>I write <a href=/music.html>music</a>, and I write <a href="/writing.html">stories</a>.

        <p>I typically make things about gender, mental illness, rave culture, small towns, leftism, and Cool Weird Shit. I don't have a lot of publicly released material, but I'm working on changing that.</p>

        <p>I have a BS in Computer Science/Game Design. I don't use it very often. If you'd like to pay me to use it, however, feel free to drop me a line.</p>

        <p>For more information on getting in touch, see my <a href="/contact.html">contact</a> page.</p>
