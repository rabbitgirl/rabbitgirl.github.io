<p>HERE'S WHAT I DO:</p>
    
<ul>
    <li>I MAKE MUSIC: Since 2012, I've released twenty-or-so personal releases (of <em>wildly</em> varying quality), written music for school projects, and even made a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rabbit_girl/sets/the-underbelly">small soundtrack</a> for a <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=preview&uid=26274">Ludum Dare entry</a> that ranked <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=top&cat=Audio(Jam)">#16 in audio (out of 1004 entries)</a>.</li>

    <li>I MAKE WORDS: After years of fussing around with worldbuilding and plans for stories, in January 2016 I bit the bullet and started <em>writing</em>. Since then, I've written three book-length first drafts (one of which is public!), abandoned a whole bunch more, and have <em>way</em> too many to work on in the future.</li>
    
    <li>I MAKE GAMES: I'm going to school for games! In my too-many years as a college student, I've prototyped several games, finished a couple, and designed <em>plenty</em> more that I'm saving for a rainy day. I'm interested in all sorts of games, and always looking for a chance to compose or write for interesting projects.</li>
    
    <li>I MAKE ART: Sometimes, and badly.</li>

    </ul>

<p>Across all of my creative pursuits, I tend to utilize similar themes and aesthetics. I'm a huge fan of works that draw from glitch aesthetics, early rave music and culture, cartoons and animation (both vintage and modern), the natural world (especially New England and the Midwest), horror aesthetics, esoteric and mystical ideologies and philosophies, and general <em>Cool Weird Stuff</em>.</p>

<p>Most of my public work is available or linked on this website; my <a href="/portfolio.html">portfolio</a> contains information on all my finished major musical and code-oriented projects, my <a href="/writing.html">writing</a> page contains summaries of everything I've written or am writing, and if you're interested, I try to keep <a href="/projects.html">this page</a> updated with whatever I'm working on at present.</p>
