<p>I have a lot of creative projects! Probably too many. Here is a partial list of almost everything original project I'm actively working on, with links to samples or subpages wherever appropriate.</p>

<ul>

    <li><b><a href=/writing/roots.html><i>Roots</i></a></b> (March 2013 - present): By <em>far</em> my longest running and most ambitious project. At any given moment, <em>this</em> is probably what I'm thinking about. Roots is a story that starts with a small town, a mysterious disappearance, and the group of friends that set out to solve it - normal Spielberg stuff - and grows increasingly weird and horrifying over the following days, weeks, months, and years. It spent almost three years on my hard drive as a constantly expanding mish-mash of character outlines, scripts, and <em>extensive</em> plot notes, but as of April 2016, I'm working on making it an actual piece of literature you can read. <a href=/writing/roots.html>There's more information about about it here</a>.</li>

    <li><b><a href=/writing/safety.html><i>Safety</i></a></b> (November 2016 - present): A short novel I wrote for <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo 2016</a> about a girl, a small coastal town, sneaking out at night, anxiety, a body in the marsh, a Thing in the water, distrust of authority, and coats. I released the <em>very</em> rough first draft as I wrote it, and you can still <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/8470309/chapters/19406956">read it here</a>. Currently: letting it sit for a month or two until it's time to rewrite the entire thing for my second draft.</li>
    
    <li><b><a href=/projects/sclera.html><i>Sclera</i></a></b> (August 2016?? - present): A 2D game engine project that builds on a lot of past similar projects that I eventually abandoned. Currently working slowly, but trying to think ahead and do follow Good Software Design practices. Aiming to have something sort of playable by the time I graduate. Sprang out of what <em>used</em> to be (and will eventually be, again) a game called Third Eye. <a href="http://bitbucket.org/rabbitgirl/sclera.html">The bitbucket repo is available here.</a></li>



</ul>

<p>...And here are some other projects that I've either shelved temporarily, or haven't had time to get going.</p>

<ul>

    <li><b>Seraph</b> (December 2013 - present): A 2D action-platformer following a mysterious android as they attempt to save the fantastical world they live on. Shelved until Sclera is advanced enough that I can utilize it for this.

    <li><b><a href="/writing/xatkhe.html"><i>Xatkhe</i></a></b> (February 2016 - present): A collection of experimental poetry, short stories, and typographical art, all  centered around a young woman's exploration of a digital post-apocalypse. Perpetually in progress.</li>

    <li><b><a href="writing/secondhandsmoke.html"><i>Secondhand Smoke</i></a></b> (April 2016 - present): A collection of short slice-of-life-ish stories, revolving around the survivors of the unexplained, mass disappearance of almost every inhabitant of a cyberpunk dystopia.</li>

    <li><b>gr - "you will never sleep alone"</b> (March 2015 - present): An album of noise/drone/glitch experimentation and sound exploration, based on the events and themes of Roots. [<a href="https://clyp.it/kweax2ye">wip 1</a>] [<a href="https://clyp.it/3cx0xsdw">wip 2</a>]</li>

    <li><b>orangeblanket</b> (August 2015 - present): A 2D adventure game engine in progress. Based off of an <a href="/portfolio/thomas05.html">old school project of mine</a>, the engine is meant to emulate text-heavy graphical adventure games such as the Famicom Detective Club and Ace Attorney games. Largely abandoned due to lack of interest.</li>
