            <li><b><a href="/projects/pokemonaesthetique.html">pokemon aesthetique</a></b> (December 2016) is a  little html/javascript tool for making Super Aesthetic pokemon teams. I wrote this because everyone else was doing it by hand, and I was too lazy to do that. </li>

            <li><b><a href="https://bitbucket.org/rabbitgirl/orangeblanket">orangeblanket</a></b> (August 2015 - present): An experiment in creating a 2D adventure game engine. Meant to emulate text-heavy graphical adventure games such as the Famicom Detective Club and Ace Attorney games. Largely abandoned due to lack of interest.</li> 

            <li><b><a href="http://bitbucket.org/rabbitgirl/sclera"><i>Sclera</i></a></b> (August 2016? - present): A 2D game engine project that builds on a lot of past similar projects that I eventually abandoned. Developed for a college project, largely as an attempt to implement proper software design practices for once in my life. Abandoned once I was done with the course.</li>
