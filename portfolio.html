<h1>music</h1>

<p>While I've been releasing music through <a href="http://music.rabbitgirl.me">bandcamp</a> since 2011, a lot of it is either no longer available, or was released while I was still getting started and isn't really up to my current standard. With that in mind, I feel comfortable recommending the following releases to get an idea of what I can do:</p>

<ul>

    <li><b><a href="https://rabbitgirl.bandcamp.com/album/places-of-interest">Rabbit Girl - Places of Interest</a></b> (2013): Fast drums and ambient music. My oldest release that I can say I'm seriously proud of.</li>

    <li><b><a href="https://rabbitgirl.bandcamp.com/album/velveteen-ep">Rabbit Girl - Velveteen EP</a></b> (2015): The first part of a follow-up to Places of Interest, building on some of the same sounds and ideas.</li>

    <li><b><a href="https://rabbitgirl.bandcamp.com/album/green-signal">108 - GREEN SIGNAL</a></b> (2014): A short and weird funk/jazz/fusion album.</li>

    <li><b><a href="https://rabbitgirl.bandcamp.com/album/glass-colossus">Cord Theory - Glass Colossus</a></b> (2014): Droning, improvisational ambient EP, recorded using only a guitar, screwdriver, and loads of digital processing.</li>

    <li><b><a href="https://rabbitgirl.bandcamp.com/album/overflow-paradise">PARTICLE EFFECT - OVERFLOW PARADISE</a></b> (2014): Very loud and very fast dance music. May not actually be danceable.</li>

</ul>

<p>In addition, I've composed for the following projects:</p>

<ul>

    <li><b><a href="https://soundcloud.com/rabbit_girl/sets/the-underbelly">underbelly OST</a></b> (April 2014, sole composer, <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=top&cat=Audio(Jam)">ranked #16 in audio in ludum dare 29</a>)</li>

</ul>

<p>And contributed to these:</p>

<br><h1>games</h1>

<p>In addition to a number of more polished, long-term works in progress, I've made several prototypes and smaller games over the last year. Sources are available for some digital games upon request. All binaries are compiled for OS X unless stated otherwise; please keep in mind that they're also mostly unstable prototypes, so be careful.</p>

<ul>

    <li><b>Gone Home the RPG</b> (analog prototype, October - November 2014): Developed for my Rapid Idea Prototyping for Games course. A pen-and-paper adaptation of <a href ="http://www.gonehomegame.com/">FullBright's 2013 game Gone Home</a>; focuses on guided player improvisation, roleplaying, and puzzle solving.

    <li><b>Recycle</b> (digital prototype, November - December 2014): Developed for my Rapid Idea Prototyping for Games course.

    <li><b>telefrag</b> (digital prototype, March - April 2015): Developed for my Foundations of Game Design course.

</ul>
    
<br><h1>code</h1>
    
<p>I don't frequently code unless I'm working on a game, but I still take on small projects every so often. These are more like toys or little utilities than anything else.</p>

    <li><b><a href="http://bitbucket.org/rabbitgirl/suan-dl">suan-dl</a></b> (November 2016): A small, cross-platform python script (and standalone executable) that rips mixtapes from the suan.fm mixtape creation service.</li>
