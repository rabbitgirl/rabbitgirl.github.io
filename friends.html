<p>Here is a short list of friends and acquaintances who I've collaborated with in the past, whose work is worth checking out, or who are just neat people.</p>

<ul>
    
    <li><a href="http://fishervk.tumblr.com"><b>Fisher V.K.</b></a>: My sibling, infrequent collaborator, and Damn Good Artist. Designs characters I couldn't even begin to dream of.</li>
    
    <li><a href="http://ducksaws.tumblr.com"><b>Steve</b></a>: One of my oldest and best friends. Reigning king of well-thought out and interesting worldbuilding.</li>
    
    <li><a href="http://abradburywallad.me/"><b>Alex Bradbury-Walled</b></a>: A close friend, fantastic person, and yet another amazing artist across more mediums than I can even to count.</li>
    
    <li><a href="http://klaufir.tumblr.com/"><b>Klaufir</b></a>: By far, one of the best artists I know. Creates some of the most surreal and beautiful paintings I've ever seen.</li>
    
</ul>
